# ssl-todo

Recruitment task by SSL solutions. I completed this task with React Js and Bootstrap. I used some random pictures and React icons for the icons due to the project's resources being unavailable. Lastly, I enjoyed working on this project cause its pretty straightforward and I look forward to getting positive feedback from the SSL team. Livesite https:/ssl-todo.vercel.app/
