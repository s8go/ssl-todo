# ssl-todo

Recruitment task by SSL solutions. I completed this task with React Js and Redux. I also used some localStorage for storing the information about the user and also store the tasks records. Lastly, I enjoyed working on this project cause its pretty straightforward and I look forward to getting positive feedback from the SSL team. Livesite https://ssl-todo.vercel.app/
